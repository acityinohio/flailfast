<h2>Just who is this asshat?</h2>
<p>Originally, when I wrote “Flailing Fast” in 2011-12, I hid my identity to ensure that I could say anything. Since publishing this work, I’ve done a lot of healthy introspection, and some unhealthy introspection (protip: several dozen MRIs significantly increases your chance of cancer and sheds zero light on the abstract nature of what lies inside you). Today, I’ve come to the conclusion that I shouldn’t dissociate my creative work from my real identity, whatever the consequences.</p>
<p>So, in that spirit, my name is Josh Cincinnati. I have worked on my own startup and at various other places. I got my MBA at Stanford and received undergraduate degrees in Political & Social Thought and Mathematics from the University of Virginia. The last time I ever wrote something this long and unintentionally funny was my undergraduate thesis. I have an irrational fear of failure, which made writing this rather tricky -- I would, at times, start crying incoherently after editing chapters. I briefly considered using a comfortable, pseudo-scientifically approved shade of blue for the book’s typeface.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in discussing the book, I’m too lazy to put together anything remotely advanced on this site, so just use <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23FlailFast">#FlailFast</a> as the “official” Twitter hashtag, or follow/tweet/verb me at <a href="http://twitter.com/ACityInOhio">@ACityInOhio</a> (if Twitter is around when you’re reading this).</p>
<h3>Against my better judgement, I want to support your work.</h3>
<p>Really?</p>
<h3>Yes, now don't make me change my mind.</h3>
<p>Right. You rock. Ever the technophile, I gladly accept cryptotips:</p>
